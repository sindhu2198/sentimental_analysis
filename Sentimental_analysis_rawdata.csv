I've read news stories with witnesses saying the child, who was only 3, literally told his mother that he was going to go inside the enclosure, and the mother still ignored the kid long enough for this to happen. 

Although the fences to keep the gorillas in aren't the tallest, it is pretty much the parents fault for being so neglectful in my opinion.

Someone has watched too many movies. This is just like the myth that a tazer will simply knock someone out. Nope. as soon as the electricity stops flowing the person can start easily moving again.

A tranquilizing dart takes up to 15-20 minutes to take full effect and cause the animal to pass out, a gorilla that is over 400 lbs is likely to take even longer. Any dose high enough to ""instantly"" ""knock out"" a gorilla that size is most likely gonna kill it.

If this was a different situation and the parents lack of attention led to the death of the child by walking out into the street, drowning in a pool, getting poisoned, etc. it'd be negligence all the way.

Not a single journalist on CNN answered this question.

Not a single journalist on CNN even asked this question. 

Mr. Greenshirt there on camera said nothing about this topic. 

Not a single reporter on BBC said anything to address this question.


I mean , seriously,  this should be the first topic we address. Did this little kid simply  step over a rock and, presto-chango, he is swimming with 400lb silverbacks?  


The Zoo should be culpable for this.  There should be a 12-foot tall chainlink fence with barbed wire at the top of these gorilla exhibits precisely for this reason.  

The only thing these ""reporters""  have said is that the boy ""slipped"" into the enclosure.  How the fuck does that even happen? He ""slipped"" ?  Wtf does that even mean?    

Is that how metropolitan zoos work now in the United States?  You ""slip"" and next thing you know your arms are being ripped out by gorillas?  Seriously?

That kid didn't just slip and fall in, he had to do some climbing to do this. The zoo HAD to do what they did. If they didn't do what they did and the kid would have been severely hurt or injured it would have cost them way more in legal fees and settlements than to kill the gorilla. This IS solely the parents fault. COME ON, what the fuck are they doing that they cannot keep their kids under control. The fucking pisses me off. There have been no talk of these parents being punished, financially or through the law. It's bullshit. It makes me even more pissed off that if I get caught with a bag of weed in Ohio I will be detained, and possibly arrested. These ignorant parents will probably get off with just  a warning.

They said the kid only fell a max of 12ft, and that situation went on for over 6 minutes. How did those parents not jump in after him? 

Nobody's left unscathed by this. I'm certain the parents feel like shit, and would (clearly, you lunatics) face death threats if their names were released. Sadly, it sounds like everyone BUT the gorilla handled this poorly.

Even if the dose is so strong that the animal has a risk of dying from it, it's still better than straight up shooting it.

Just today  I had to, along with my SO and her boss, keep an eye out on   the 3 year old of some woman who was looking at T-shirts on a sidewalk rack  so he didn't run into the road.  It's like she expected strangers to be vigilant as if he were their own. She had some sob story about living in her car and maybe was too mentally worked up/tired to give 100% attention... or maybe found  comfort in numbers thing?  I have no idea what she was thinking but we kept the kid out of the road and made sure she knew it was fucked up of her to put that on us, in a as polite as can be way. 


But if a 4 year old can get into a gorilla enclosure then it's not secure enough. That's on the zoo. Some parents are watching 3-4 children that can range in age and blah blah, variables.... It doesn't matter.  Enclosures should be idiot proof in the sense that even a mentally handicapped, yet physically fit,  teenager couldn't get in  without some serious effort.    

Parents need to control their kids but businesses need to minimize risk. You can't expect all parents to have 100% control 100% of the time.  The world doesn't work that way and shit can happen in a short minute or two even with the most well behaved children.  And  calling for keeping kids on leashes is retarded and, imho, inhumane. 


As much as people like shit to be one sided - right or wrong - this is one of those cases where liability is more of a split between the parent and zoo.  We will learn who is more at fault with time but I'm guessing the zoo will be. ",news

Warchaser99,2016-05-29 11:45:29,"That child deserved to die! 

Let's discuss why valuing the gorrilla over the child isn't even logical from a darwinist viewpoint. What I do know is that from a pure evolutionary viewpoint we are the dominant species and so we can do whatever atrocities we want to the lower beings (gorillas) because isn't that what survival of the fittest is? The animal kingdom is a cruel world so suck it up and deal with another dead animal (or extinct species). You are merely another random combination of cells and your word means nothing on here because you do not have power and authority. He who has the gold makes the rules (Golden Rule). So you can whine and complain and swear up and down that the child should have died and the gorilla live but that's contradictory to even the evolutionary principles defined by Darwin and the philosophy of ""Survival of the fittest"". There is no moral absolutes so go pack up your bags and get out because unless you have power in this world you are nothing more than the price of your organs. 

Now that that is out of the way, let's discuss reality. It's a tragedy on all fronts that this happened and that the gorilla had to die. I don't know the situation with the parents so I'm not going to judge there (There's a lot of you who will send these parents to hell before knowing the situation. I think you should take a look at the log in your own eye). I don't know the park so i'm not going to judge the architects or keepers either (they even gave the gorilla 10 min. of ""dragging"" the child around before they pulled the trigger). 

But what I do know is that if you have a civilization that doesn't value human life over a gorilla (that random people on the internet don't even know) then you have a screwed up civilization. Where on earth is your mercy people!? Where is the grace!? You declare death to the child, the parents, the park personnel and you know nothing of the situation! Even if the parents weren't paying good attention is that really a good reason to declare the child's death sentence over a single animal of a single species (endangered or not)? What makes the gorilla so valuable? Because there is less of them? There is no evolutionary law for that! Would that make your iphone 2 more valuable than the 6? 

The fact of the matter is a child fell into the gorilla pit, the keepers gave the gorilla 10 freaking minutes of dragging the child around before MOURNFULLY deciding to pull the trigger. It's a tragedy but put down your pitchforks and use a little logic here. Any person on here could have gotten distracted for a split second or thought the zoo was more secure or anything. Heck knowing how wild of a child I was it could have been me at that age. One day if you ever have children you will learn what the word love truly means. And for goodness sake, I hope you don't treat your family, significant other, etc. with the same judgement you have here. Learn to give grace and mercy. I think we all know we humans aren't perfect.

imaginaryideals,2016-05-29 05:50:34,"This is going to get buried, but I'm going to share anyway. 

When I was 8, I got into a badly secured animal exhibit in Taiwan. I had a lot of extended family and it was just my mom and aunt keeping track of all the cousins on the trip, and I slipped off on my own when we got to the animals. 

It was basically a petting zoo or something that was part of a larger amusement park. This one had a single little monkey in a large cage. The cage was surrounded by a wooden fence. The fence had a gap in it. It was a fairly narrow gap, but I was a small kid and squeezing through it was easy. I'd recently seen some old musical film involving a chimpanzee and an orphan and thought I could make friends with the monkey. It scratched me in the eye. I spent the rest of my vacation wearing an eyepatch (but thankfully, that was it, and I healed fine. My first experience with medical tourism!)

There are multiple points of failure here. A lot of people are demonizing the parents, but really, it's not just the parents. The zoo is at fault, too.

If you're going to keep wild animals in captivity and show them to the populace, you should probably implement proper security measures. Small kids shouldn't be able to squeeze into enclosures no matter how small they are. ",news

Its an awful awful shame to see a gorilla being shot! What a majestic animal truly! I am not someone who hates human beings, but this whole situation is totally wrong for several reasons:
1. Why do Zoos exist still? Why divorce an animal from its natural habitat just so some stupid humans can enjoy captive nature?! 

2. The parents, I am sorry to say, are the biggest morons I could imagine here! They let their child go astray. NOT COOL! An animal had to die for that neglect! Maybe they are not fit to be parents - just saying!

3. The Zoo is an environment curated by Humans for their selfish benefit. That does not give them rights to prioritize their living over another creature! Who gave them the moral authority? The human race is barbaric to creatures around them!

I am obviously very partial towards the Gorilla, especially because its a very clever and majestic ape! To add, there are very few of them left. It was a prisoner to humans and its life was purely for our entertainment and education. How sad is that?!

The parents in this case are stupid and so is the kid. Maybe the world has moved beyond natural selection as far as humans go, but this time it should have taken its course. I don't know. I am angry and terribly sad with this and had to say something somewhere. ",news

Rather than call in a SWAT team perhaps a negotiator (ie the keeper and caretaker that the ape would see as family) would have been more suitable to handle the situation.

I highly encourage zoo officials think more about how to properly handle situations like this, even if we sacrifice some of the ""up close enjoyment"" in favor of more secure environments where negligent parents or maniacal thrill seekers can be kept away from these animals. We are supposed to be protecting these endangered species, and though I agree the life of a human is worth more than any animal, these animals should also be held in more importance than they are now.

It should be about what's fair, and this isn't. The only idiots are the parents and that kid. The gorilla didn't do anything wrong yet it is the one who pays for those people's stupidity. If you're dumb enough to fall in there then you should have to deal with the consequences. 

Furthermore, I would argue that the endangered gorilla's life is more valuable than that kid's. Gorillas are capable of many of the same complex emotions humans are.

I don't think it's necessary to call people idiots just because they think an endangered gorilla is more valuable than one of the billions of humans currently in this world. The loss of the child would have been unfortunate but it wouldn't have threatened our species. I understand that the biological urge to prioritize human children above literally everything else is very strong in most people, but in the bigger picture, a single human child doesn't really matter. We're just another animal and there are too many of us anyway. You're having an extreme emotional response...the same extreme emotional response that lead to the death of the gorilla.

He was dragging the kid around with agitation already in the water. Even if he meant no harm, that's enough to cause serious injuries.

 In those previous cases neither gorilla was violent or threatening the kid and they physically moved away from the kid long enough for humans to intervene without anyone getting hurt (and in the case of the Brookfield Zoo, that female gorilla basically brought the kids to a safe place where it could be retrieved by keepers). That didn't happen here. That male gorilla wasn't going to let him go. 

It was not about ""trust"" in the case of the English zoo. That was great fortune and timing. 

The 1996 case is shocking; gorillas go to service doors to meet their caretakers for treats and toys. It's very unusual a gorilla would actually bring something she knew wasn't hers back to the keepers (as I see it). 

People would have been calling for the zookeeper's heads and the family would have bankrupted the zoo if the gorilla had even broken a bone.

the calf was *already abandoned* when they found it. It had been swept downstream when its herd had crossed a river. it would have died had they not picked it up. and them picking it up actually gave it a higher chance of survival than leaving it. the fact that it died anyway because the herd wouldnt accept it isnt exactly a condemnation of their actions.

I see a lot of parents today worrying themselves sick that their kids will ever be sad or have a shitty experience, even if they brought it on themselves. No. This is not correct.

The 400-pound gorilla, which turned 17 on Friday, was “slamming the child into the wall,” according to Cincinnati police reports on the incident. Witnesses said the child was screaming as he was being dragged, WCPO reported.
The zoo’s dangerous animal response team decided to kill Harambe because the boy was in immediate danger and a tranquilizer has a delayed effect, Maynard said.

Cincinnati seems to have lots of accessible employees to give talks at the exhibits on a regular schedule and interact with guests in a more personal way. They'll answer all your questions and they're just always around. 

The food is far, far better in Cinci. And that's really not a small thing. Guests pay a small fortune for food and drinks. It's expected to at least be decent and edible.

Vhett,2016-05-29 06:49:41,"I sort of want to chime in since I believe in all earnest that I have a unique viewpoint from being a camp counselor- but I also don't want to blatantly seem like I'm saying ""Hey listen to my opinion!"", but I'll give it a go.

I had to be responsible for twelve children in my cabin. Some may have had special needs. Some may have had allergies. In fact, I had a cabin where each of those scenarios were present. I'll never forget that kid's allergy ""Wheat, Soy, Eggs, and Milk."", aka the kid could eat almost nothing. I fucked up once, and almost let him eat something that would have most likely sent him to the hospital. Luckily our nurse was nearby and was like ""Oh my God that contains WheatSoyEggsOrMilk!"" 

I had been on my A game every day for over a week (two-week sessions at a time), but there was one meal where I just didn't think of it. It would have only taken about 5 seconds for him to take a spoonful of food had the nurse not been there when she was. Now, I'll relate that to the current issue. Keep in mind, I had another 11 kids to look after on top of WheatSoyEggsAndMilk.

A parent takes their kid to the zoo. Hell, maybe it's two parents. They're strolling along, and little Johnny says he wants to see the gorillas real bad. Heck, this sounds like a good idea to take a photo so he can remember this moment in future. So Johnny gets near the enclosure, and mom and dad are going to take a picture. Oh, shoot, where did they put the camera?! Dad can't find it, so mom opens up her bag that all moms seem to have on day trips that contain everything- all while dad searches through the bag. In those five seconds of digging to find the camera, the kid hops the enclosure, falls in, or does something irreversible. Are the parents negligent? We don't know. We don't know if Johnny ever acts out like this. Maybe he was just super excited and an accident happened.

Point being, there are variables, and it is *so* hard to be foolproof in parenting, counseling, etc. 

Maybe a more relatable scenario would be the new sunscreen issue. If you're a counselor and a camper gets sunscreen, you can be sued or negligence causing bodily harm to a camper. I shit you not. I could be putting sunscreen on camper after camper, but if little Johnny runs out the door before I get to him- and gets sunburnt...welp. I'm getting sued. 

Second point being. There's negligence, and reasonable negligence. I shouldn't *have* to hold a camper's hand everywhere I go, because it's expected they can reasonably look after themselves in most cases. However, if something happens where I'm *not* holding their hand, naturally everyone will shout ""Why weren't you holding their hand?!""- which is this thread in a nutshell.",news

Going to the zoo? Kids have to hold hands in a line if they're following/at an exhibit. As soon as that link breaks, I'll know, and I'll be ready to act. If a kid refuses to, or doesn't want to? Fine, they're waiting at the gates/not coming in. Any kid would want to see the zoo, and behave so long as you make it incredibly clear those are the rules- and enforce them.

Maybe not from a legal perspective but from an ethically perspective, this is absolutely wrong and is nothing but species bias.

When you factor in the *rarity* of the gorilla compared to the rarity of the human, the value of the gorilla is ENORMOUSLY higher than the value of the human. In this case, they should have tried to tempt the gorilla over with its favorite food and failing that, taken a chance with the tranquilizer. The gorilla probably should not have been shot even at risk to the kid. The only argument going for the kid is that the gorilla was an older male and the human was a child.

I've been to the exhibit many times, the great thing about it is that there isn't much obstruction between you and the animals. There is a moat to keep the animal from escaping, but just a small rail and bushes to keep people out of the enclosures. The primary method of safety are multiple signs warning people to stay clear of the fence and hold on to their kids. Quite a few of the large animal exhibits at the Cincinnati Zoo are set up this way. It's nice in that it gives people a good view and helps responsible people better observe the animals.

However, in court, I could definitely see it being argued that although the family was irresponsible, the Zoo didn't provide enough safety measures. And in all honesty--like if I were designing the enclosure--I would have put up a better fence since I know there are far more irresponsible people in this world than there are responsible people.

No you fucking wouldn't. You would do anything to save your child. You'd do anything possible, even throw yourself out there, if the gorilla started to thrash or maim your child. You'd steal a gun and shoot the gorilla yourself if you had to. 

You're looking at this situation from a logical, rational perspective - endangered gorilla vs child of an overpopulated species. Humans cannot always think this logically. We *innately care* for our species more than any other, and that's true for every living thing on this planet. If it weren't, that living thing wouldn't be alive, it'd be extinct.

Thank you tourists for caring, but no thanks for your ignorance. The anger is about the ignorance, not for having a heart.

torenvalk,2016-05-29 11:45:10,"For the exact same reason they chose to use lethal force: he is an incredibly powerful animal in a stressed and unpredictable state. Gorillas are managed in protected contact in 99% of Zoos. This means the keepers never go in the same space with the animals and work with them through steel mesh (like very heavy duty chain link fence). That doesn't mean you can't touch or interact with them, you can, but it is protected contact. They can't 'get' you. Big cats are managed in the same way. 

Our silver backs regularly 'displayed' at us, which meant running full force across the room and slamming into the mesh full force to make us jump.  It took a lot of willpower to train yourself to not flinch when 450 lbs of Gorilla flesh comes straight at you, as that was exactly the reaction they wanted. It was mostly just to tease us, but it gave you a very clear idea of just how powerful they are. 

 Before I started at my zoo, the gorillas had escaped their rooms, but were still contained in the house. The keepers had escaped to safety zones (a kind of closet with mesh doors) in the house and closed themselves in. The younger male, not yet a silver back, slammed the door to the hiding keeper so hard it broke the concrete around the steel frame. This was a sweet and gentle animal in most moments but he was stressed and scared in that situation and he reacted with force. The cracks were still there when I worked in the house, and they were used as a warning to new keepers. 

I have no doubt that the gorilla wouldn't consciously hurt the child or even a keeper out of malice. But they are reactive animals, and massive. Just by pure size they could kill someone, certainly a toddler. I also have no doubt that the keepers were begging to do something like going in to save the child, hoping to save their gorilla this fate. But just like any emergency situation, you don't want to end up with two people in danger instead of just one.",news
FPHdidnothingwrong,2016-05-29 11:23:50,"Gorillas are territorial, very strong animals. Not only was this an asset for financial gain, this is a publicity nightmare. At the end of the day, zoos do not exist for financial gain, they are about conservation and research, and negative press hurts their revenue could hurt their future. Cincinnati was known in its early days for it aviary conservation, has bred Sumatran rhinos, done so much good that many do not realize. They would have done anything and everything to save an endangered species, a cornerstone of one of their newest exhibits, and as a primate, one of the brightest animals in the animal kingdom. It was too big of a risk to wait and see if the tranquilizers would take hold before the gorilla killed dat boi. It is horrible on so many ways. This is the zoo equivalent of killing someone you love. They would never do so lightly.",news
torenvalk,2016-05-29 16:44:43,"Who knows? And that is exactly the problem. Gorillas for all their size are not the bravest of creatures. He might have run away and they could have saved the boy. He might have charged and crushed the rescuer. He might have thrown the child at this new interloper. Anything could have happened. Would you be the one to risk it? 

I am sure there were keepers that wished to do just that, or were fighting for any other option. No matter the choice, there is a risk. But putting two lives at risk is rarely a good idea. 

",news
torenvalk,2016-05-29 21:08:43,"According to the zoo, he was becoming more violent and tossing the boy around. If he had just been sitting in the corner ignoring the boy they might have tried tranquillizers or other options but they had to make a split second decision to save the child, or his next move could have killed the kid. 

I promise you not one person at the zoo wanted this result and it would not be the decision if there was any other choice. 

It's a terrible terrible thing for everyone.  Poor Harambe. 
",news
torenvalk,2016-05-29 19:11:20,"I said this somewhere below but tranquillizers are fickle things, especially when the animal is upset. Adrenalin can cause the drugs to not take effect or take a long time. You have to get the chemical cocktail just right even when they are relaxed. Tranq darts don't work like they do in the movies. 

 Some animals can even get aggressive as they fall asleep,trying to fight it off. 

 I am surprised that they weren't able to call the gorilla back inside away from the boy, the gorillas I worked with would have noped the hell out of that situation. But I am sure they tried that and it was unsuccessful. (edit: that is what happened. The females went inside but Harambe stayed out with the boy and was becoming more violent.) Awful decision, awful situation.

",news
torenvalk,2016-05-29 20:37:48,"Yes, many zoos do this for their deceased animals, not just primates. I don't know if there are any papers on it but anecdotally it helps the groups to move on and exactly as you say, not pine for the lost one. 

We are pretty sure wild ravens have funerals of a sort, and elephants visit the bones of other elephants. Whether they understand that it is a former group mate is difficult to say. 

I think animals do have some concept of death when they meet it. But that is hard to describe in a rational way. ",news

How many people learned from this thread that lowland gorillas are endangered, who otherwise wouldn't have given a shit about gorillas?  Some animals, like pandas, have the benefit of being cute and photogenic.  Otherwise a huge amount of education the public gets about endangered animals unfortunately comes from zoos.

I'm not saying that zoos are the best or only solution/way to educate people about the destruction of habitat, endangered animals, etc., but to act as if the only reason for zoos to exist today is so that they can profit from people wanting to come and look at animals is really shortsighted and purposefully ignorant of just how much humans have already impacted animals.

The Gorilla World exhibit opened in 1978 as the first naturalistic gorilla habitat in the United States. The exhibit is complete with waterfalls, large trees, and ways on how guests can help save gorillas. The Cincinnati Zoo currently has had the most gorilla births than any other zoo in the country with 48, the last being in 2006. In 1996, six gorillas were born, the most in one year. The first test tube gorilla, Timu, was born at the zoo as-well in in 1995. Due to many breeding efforts, the zoo was named the ""Sexiest Zoo in America"", by Newsweek. Currently eight gorillas reside at the zoo.

1. Western Lowland Gorilla (M: Jomo (seen). F: Mara, Anju (seen), Asha (seen), M'Linzi, Samantha, Chewie, Gladys)

The way it's edited makes me think the person who uploaded it did that on purpose to make it seem like some trigger happy zookeepers killed a gentle, innocent gorilla.  I mean, when I saw the edited video first, I thought, ""man, it doesn't look so bad,"" but I figured the dangerous stuff was happening off camera.  Nope.  Some douche with an agenda is my best bet.

Also, if you look on the YouTube video, many comments say the gorilla ""would never hurt the child, because they're gentle and love people.""  That video was definitely pandering to them.",news
rirura,2016-05-29 14:22:53,"That looks really terrible, but I guess the Gorilla still 'thought' of protecting the child aka. taking him away from the screaming mass, just not in the gentle manner we humans are used to… So in the end, it was dangerous for the child because of several things happening all at once(screams, hurt from the fall, nervous gorilla etc.), causing this 'possible' danger to grow into something scary that might have ended up worse(for the child). ",news
deleted,2016-05-31 18:00:44,"I've seen similar things happen with wild gorillas where they drag a person around briefly and let them go. It is more like a threat display than a deliberate attempt to hurt the person, even though they can and do hurt people. I don't know if this is a similar case but it looks similar and the circumstances are similar (group of humans watching, one human gets too close, male gorilla does a threat display by dragging that human).

It's worth mentioning that Gorillas and other apes, and lots of other animals, get stressed out from prolonged eye-contact and staring, which is why modern enclosures are designed with out-of-sight areas.

It's possible that if people hadn't freaked out, then things would have gone differently. It's entirely possible that the gorilla dragged the boy around with the goal of making everyone else fuck off and stop screaming and staring at him, without wanting to directly hurt the boy.

I don't blame the zookeepers at all for how they handled this, and I'm not going to fault people for acting like humans when they see a child in danger, but this whole incident has opened up a discussion about how we keep animals in captivity.

There is a great need for zoos to have enclosures which prevent animals from getting out, and anything else from getting in, which means that standards need to be updated. This incident was preventable, and while we can always hope that individual's will act rationally, we cannot risk the occasional child/idiot/mentally ill person falling into an enclosure.

The only part of the zoo that has a dedicated ""guard"" is the insectarium's free flying butterfly room (and only because it's FDA mandated).  If the zoo had the resources to hire actual paid guards to monitor areas like this where enclosure fences could potentially be breached this might have been preventable, because even if mom and dad are oblivious to the kid saying he wants to go into the enclosure a guard whose entire job is ""make sure nobody throws shit in/tries to jump in"" sure as shit would be on it. Part of the security/dedicated guard job is to radio in incidents and secure areas and guests in emergencies, which in this case would be getting security assistance to clear the area of anyone who isn't family and radioing the keeping staff the instant someone breaches the fence (or if you're doing your job properly, snatching up that kid before he can get to the fence)",news

hafetysazard,2016-05-29 07:58:32,"Look up what attractive nuisance means.  If the zoo didn't take all reasonable precautions to ensure the enclosure was not going to allow a child to get in, then they must assume much of the blame for the accident.  

You should know that children don't read warning signs, they do not see barriers as barriers, they're blind to the concept of obstacles being designed to prevent intrusion, obstacles to adults are not necessarily obstacles for kids, and kids are basically trained to subvert obstacles.  A child is unable to make a judgement call like, ""this thing looks like it is meant to prevent people from getting in there,"" but would instead think, ""oh that looks like another thing to climb on.""

Children can move their little bodies really quickly, and a distracted parent who is averting his gaze for *a few seconds* expecting for his son to be at his knees wouldn't reasonably expect that his son has managed to climb into the animal enclosure.  Yet people often think they can read, answer, and deliver text messages while driving confident they know what is going on, and within those split seconds tragedy can happen, but it usually doesn't because people don't often get that unlucky.

Sadly, people are saying when a parent gets distracted for a second, suddenly it is pure neglect, right up there with starving kids to death, giving them drugs, not clothing them, or whatever horrors we hear about.  Fuck that ignorant mentality.  People arguing that this parent is neglectful, because he is not somehow infallible or can reasonably expected to be 100% aware 100% of the time of what his child does is doing, is so fucking stupid.  Most cases of a parent letting their kid out of their sight results in a bump on the head, some object being broken, or a small mess; and that is the norm, not the exception.  Doctor's tell you that when you take your kid to an emergency room, shortly after they learned to flop around, and happened to fall off the couch when you turned your back for 4 seconds went to go throw the dirty diaper away.  So few parents are so unlucky that it happens that the child is killed, or hurt, in that instant.  If you're not a parent, and you expect it to be possible to be able to monitor a kid 60/60/24/7/365 you're living in a dream world.  Even if you are a parent and you say this, you're too new as it hasn't happened yet, or you're vastly overestimating your abilities to parent, and are narcissistically attributing your good luck as being some willfully good parenting; again keep dreaming.",news

Sadly, the lesson I finally learned this year, after nearly 10 in the classroom, is that one comment from a well-intentioned stranger isn't going to change a person's parenting philosophy, especially in a situation where a kid is behaving like an ass. All you'll do is piss them off. Turns out, nobody cares about anyone's opinion of their parenting.

Many are injured or sick, were moved for* protection from poachers or habitat loss, were ""pets"" that owners couldn't care for, and so on. 

Even now, a lot of zoo animals are bred and born in zoos and moved to new zoos. 

Breeding programs and research and conservation are what the honest zoos are all about. 

Without zoos my son couldn't see a gorilla so close he could touch it (through thick acrylic observation walls). Which makes him care about gorillas.

You see animal issues on the news about animals being poached or losing habitat or something and it's easy to distance yourself. But you go to the zoo and see elephants do tricks (like flapping their ears at the world ""ears"" not circus tricks) during the keeper talks and see personality and attitude, and it makes you care about saving the ones in the wild. 

One of my zoos new [elephants](http://imgur.com/9zrcfjA). A family of elephants was saved from drought in Swaziland, with a lot of work with the conservation area there. They would not have survived, between finding water, finding ever shrinking territory to live, and so on. One of them came from the conversation area in Swaziland pregnant, and just had the calf. 

And now, that conservation area in Swaziland has money to provide their workers and elephants protection from poachers, people are more aware of what's going on there now and donating money to the conservation, the elephants that stayed are better off in food, space, and protection while still living a natural life.",news

In an area in a big city with incredibly high traffic on a weekend 30 feet away from dangerous animals in a place with fences, barriers, and warning signs all over that say stay off  and animals are dangerous? Yeah you can keep an eye on your kids for the 30 minutes you spend near the enclosures with deadly animals. Neglect them at the petting zoo or the aquarium. 

I love the cincy zoo, I'm going there on Monday actually. This barrier isn't as small as they make it seem in pictures, I've always thought it was bigger than necessary. you keep somewhat close to your kid instead of posting selfies with them on fb and checking the comments the whole time and you're fine. Zoos are meant to house rare, endangered, dangerous animals, and are in a high traffic area that would just increase dangers for a kid, abduction or physical harm or other things. 

Why the fuck is anyone not paying attention to them, parents or bystanders alike? That gorilla didn't deserve to die, and considering that the zoo sees a million people a year without incident, the zoo is not at fault- if your kid is old enough to walk but not old enough to make decisions, they are 100% your responsibility every moment you are in a public setting, zero exceptions. My kids didn't fall in an animal enclosure, a million others didn't either. Zoos are essentially made entirely for kids, if your kids aren't 1000% your focus at this place the entire time you are there, you are a bad parent. Your kids reactions to these animals is the parent's benefit when they go to the zoo. Shitty parenting and neglect at the wrong time.

I turned around to find a stranger on my doorstep, holding my baby. I'd been vacuuming with the door open (but flyscreen closed) to get fresh air in - my toddler had never been tall enough to reach the door handle before, but I guess he'd had a growth spurt I hadn't noticed and so in the minute and a half my back was turned, he had opened the flyscreen door and sprinted onto the street. Thank god that person found him when they did, and so quickly, and that they were a good person.

Of course, from that day forward I never opened my front door again - technically I could lock the flyscreen door but I don't want a day to come where he's figured out how to unlock it without my knowledge - but sometimes you don't know what they know or can do until they demonstrate in the scariest way possible.

I think that since I was given a little room to roam in safe places, like the grocery store, I took it seriously when I was told I needed to stay close or be careful.... like at the lake or in a  zoo. I know not all kids can be treated this way, but I think very many can yet aren't because of the fear we as a culture have learned to instill in our kids and ourselves of dangers that aren't real.... or as prevalent as people would like us  to think.

Crosswalks exist so that people can cross streets safely, the expectation is also that parents don't let their kids run down across them into oncoming traffic.  If a kid does that and gets injured, does that prove the crosswalk design is faulty or bad?  Or does that just mean that in the real world, you literally cannot idiot proof everything?

No one said that going to the zoo equates to bad parenting.  Going to the zoo without being able to safely watch your kids though?  And yes, maybe this was a mom with several young children and she was minding the baby while a toddler was running around, etc.  If she's leading many kids down a crosswalk again and one of her kids runs off and gets hit by a car, do we hold the city government accountable for bad design?  

If you leave your pet/baby in a hot car, do you sue the car manufacturer for bad design?  I mean, cars are designed to transport people, the expectation is that the car should keep the kid/dog safe, right?  It's not like it's the parents' responsibility...at least not in YOUR reasoning.

A parent and their children are living in a society with the rest of us, most of you CLEARLY are not as good or noble for simply parenting as you tell the people you blame you are, given how many kids injure others or get injured themselves in public spaces and on public transit, and then you blame other people for the job of watching your children, even at a risk to ourselves. In this case a rare animal and a member of that zoological family died because the zoo anticipated a lawsuit if it did what likely could have happened and killed the toddler, who said he wanted to go into the enclosure. 

You can say ""parenting is impossible"", you can blame the zoo (on some level, I do too), I could nod my head and say kids are always running away--but a creature **still** died because that toddler precipitated a situation where the zoo had to choose, either kill the gorilla that's becoming agitated, or let the gorilla harm the kid (and the parents sue the zoo).

Anybody that has to study animals for a living will explain that there are whole courses in school dedicated to the necessity of refraining from giving an animal emotions it likely is not having. The reason the dangerous animals team likely killed the gorilla was because they were able to recognize that what looks like protective, caring behavior to us, was in fact possessive behavior that could turn sour very quickly. Animals can change on a dime, and that's why people should stay away from them. We can never truly predict what an animal is feeling/thinking. Here's a video of a gorilla that goes from 0-60 in the span of 10 seconds, a behavior that could easily be made an example of when a panicking kid is being held captive by a gorilla that is suddenly surrounded by humans screaming at it.

I'm saying that at minimum that barrier should have been solid glass so that a child could not duck between the ropes. 

You're never going to make a barrier totally impassible to adults, but if the kid had to climb over a barrier, it would be harder for them and way more likely an adult would have noticed (vs ducking under a rope at knee height). 

It's fine if viewers lean on a fence. If you're saying that the barrier should have been taller, I think that is reasonable as well.",news

Right, like when the woman balanced her toddler on the fence above the African wild dog enclosure at the Chicago(?) zoo. There isn't much you can do about that sort of choice without ruining the exhibit. That doesn't mean you can't/shouldn't do anything to safeguard the public and your animals.

You can't see through this fence anyways because there are bushes in front of it, so why not make it glass and pay for someone to clean it. Or make it of rigid bars or tensioned cable so a child cannot squeeze through and disappear into the foliage in 1 second. 

When you choose to exhibit wild animals to the public, primarily to families, you should design exhibits so that it is very hard for an errant child to enter them. We all know children are oblivious and that parents sometimes lose track of them, this is just a fact of dealing with the public.

Of course, tempered glass has been around for a while, too, so there is no reason they couldn't have that up as a physical barrier without obstructing the view.

Anyway, reddit is full of young kids who don't have children of their own.  They think that if you tell your kids something once or twice, the lesson will stick.  They think it's possible to watch your kid 100% of the time.  They also think that freakin ZOO has no duty to anticipate that young kids would be attracted to their exhibits, and therefore safeguard the exhibits.

It sucks that the animal got shot, but the blood is on the hands of the zoo.  They did the right thing in killing the animal, and the wrong thing in failing to secure the enclosure.

As for the mom... there's definitely some negligence there.  But it's secondary.    We're not talking about a 12 year old that climbed and leaped a fence... we're talking about a 4-year-old... what kind of barrier can't keep a 4 year old out?  honestly.",news

There are a whole host of factors at play here:

If there hadn't been two kids, the mother wouldn't have gotten distracted.

If the mother were less able to get distracted in the first place, she would have spotted him and caught him before it was too late.

If the kid had been old enough to understand how dangerous the situation was (he was only four years old, remember, logical decision making isn't exactly a forte at that age), he wouldn't have gone for it.

While ideally, yes, the parents should have kept an eye on their kids, in reality, you know 100% of parents will not keep an eye on their kids 100% of the time. If there is a gap in the bars for a toddler to fit through, with tens of thousands of toddlers visiting the exhibit each year, it's bound to happen eventually. If it wasn't this kid, it would have happened to someone else. Therefore, as the zoo, it is your responsibility to take preventative measures to prevent that from happening.

>You know wild animals can and may very will kill a child if it enters their exhibit.

Yes, which is why all enclosures of dangerous animals have security measures to prevent people from entering their exhibit. It is the responsibility of the zoo to prevent this from accidentally happening. If someone fell in due to something unusual or negligence, such as someone making deliberate attempts to get in, or a drunk person falling in because they were leaning over the railing and couldn't balance, then I get it.

But if a toddler can slip and fall in, that is something you need to prevent before it happens. ",news

Even for a second.

Good. As it should be. I'm not saying otherwise.

>Furthermore, if my toddler child fell in pit with a gigantic wild animal dragging it around I wouldn't sit there and do nothing. I'd be down there doing anything I could to save my kids life. Maybe that's insane but that's what I'd do.

This would be very reckless. All this will accomplish is make the zoo have to rescue two people instead of one

>In my opinion, we can safely conclude these parents suck as parents. You might disagree and that's fine.

I don't think we have enough information about how the child fell in to make that judgement. You don't know if the whole thing happened in a split second too fast for the parents to react.

I agree and disagree. You prepare for what you think can happen, but you won't prepare for what you think won't happen or don't know. Not everything is 100% safe, but that's why it's imperative that parents bringing their small children to places like this are constantly watching their kids. Let's say a 3 yr old was kidnapped by a molester; are we going to blame the zoo or are we going to question the parent's judgment by not watching their kid?

I'm no expert at shooting an infant out of my baby cannon, but I put in more early childhood hours with my sisters than my mom (not her fault, she had to put food on the table).

So again, why? Putting aside for a moment the instinctual response inbuilt into our animal brains ""same species offspring must be protected"", objectively **why** is one toddler more important than a breeding male of a dying species?

joshlittle333,2016-05-29 06:26:20,"I think people should look at the circumstances and context of a situation. The example I was responding to was ""when a child crosses the road"". The example you countered with was running into oncoming traffic. What I was trying to point out is that is not an equal comparison and the new example is still not an equal comparison. The average person would identify a potential hazard when crossing the street and take more caution than usual.

Going back to the context of this situation, a child was able to push through some bushes and ended up in a gorilla enclosure. Does that sound like a reasonable design? I've been to several zoos and while they haven't been ""idiot proof"" They still typically have solid 4 foot walls and moats that much more difficult for the animals to get into and out or solid full glass windows. 

While in hindsight, people are quick to say the parent should have used more caution, the average person does not immediately assess zoos as danger zones. If you do assess them as danger zones, then I think a family day trip to a danger zone is bad parenting, just like I wouldn't go on a family picnic into oncoming traffic.

Edit: I didn't mean to ignore your last paragraph, but it looks like you wrote it in the moment and will probably realize it's also not an equal comparison. Just in case you don't realize that though, no I don't expect cars to keep someone cool when they are turned off in sun with the windows rolled up.

TheCuteTachikoma,2016-05-29 04:16:21,"Yes and no. I fully agree that parenting is lax these days. This whole ""ask your child"" instead of telling them, etc., is a bunch of BS. Every time I see a kid throwing a fit in the store, or running around  like a maniac totally unsupervised, I want to pull the parent aside and rip them a new one...

That being said, however, _kids don't listen_. Toddlers don't listen. They are constantly trying to push boundaries because they don't know where they lie and they're trying to figure the world out. A perfectly behaved kid can have a bad day. For all we know this boy had never been to the zoo, period. How would the parents know how their kid is going to behave in a new enviroment??? So what, are we supposed to not introduce our children to new situations because of how they might possibly react? Do we sit here and berrate parents for not being vigilant enough of their children, for not keeping them in a bubble or on a literal leash as some posters have suggested? If we deny people new experiences how are they supposed to grow, and learn, and become functioning members of society?

How about this? How about we as a society just accept for once that sometimes shit happens and sometimes the outcome sucks and is unfortunate. That's life, and I'm sorry freaking deal with it. For all we know this little boy bit his mother, something he's never done before, which surprised her, so she let go of his hand for a split second and he darted into the enclosure. Or maybe he's a snot nosed brat that could stand to have a spanking or two. Or hey--did you ever think that maybe he's DISABLED? Does the article say if he has Downs Syndrome or is autistic? But yes--lets continue to lambast the parents who I guaretee were SCARED TO DEATH that their little boy was going to DIE because SOMEone has to be a fault at every unfortunate situation. Maybe the parents don't deserve to be parents, but maybe they're awesome parents and shit happens--we don't know!

Bottom line is we don't know. For heavens sake, lets stop this circle jerk of whose at fault and take it for what the situation is--be thankful the little boy is ok (presumably), and be sad for the gorilla. Why must someone be at fault for everything????? Shit happens.",news
thissideisup,2016-05-29 05:41:10,"> A gorilla's life is worth less than a human's. That's just something you're going to have to come to terms with.

Or, lets target the specific part of that phrase that applies to you:

> That's just something you're going to have to come to terms with.

Regardless of your views, the vast majority of humanity values their own lives and the lives of their offspring over all others. This is a key survival instinct. If human survival depended on the elimination of gorillas from earth, they would be destroyed. Our own survival takes priority any other species survival without question. 

But, we're an intelligent and successful species. So we like to capture, study, and view animals via Zoos. And some of us like to donate a portion of our earnings towards the preservation of these animal's natural habitat. Because we don't need to destroy them to survive and we're empathetic enough to appreciate their desire and right to life, as long as it doesn't interfere with our own.

But to focus that empathy only towards the animal and at the expense of the human, that just doesn't add up. So if you fell into that cage and your life was on the line, you would wave off the keepers and hope the gorilla doesn't decide you're a threat? Well, that's your choice. The majority of the rest of humanity (myself included) would be very grateful for the keeper's timely shooting of the gorilla to save our stupid asses. And after we're safely out of harms way, I'm sure most of us would feel bad about a gorilla having to pay for our stupidity. Yet, we're still breathing so at least there is that.",news

The blame isn't entirely on the parents. He didn't scale a fence, he crawled through the railing which means the zoo needs to do some reexamination of what widths are required.

 It's definitely on the parents too, if the kid was trying to get a better look and crawled through without realizing that there was a massive drop(Which is to be expected of a 4 year old) they should have picked him up so he could see/foreseen that he wouldn't be able to see well.

There's a difference between watching your kid every second and not letting them climb on a 2ft brick wall with a 3 foot guard rail atop it. 2nd line of defense is a cliff edge covered in very thick bushes. 3rd is an electric wire fence (this is a two wires and is to keep the gorillas in, 4th is wood slats that cover the visitor side wall of the moat.

I have gained a little information from a friend who works at the zoo. The mother was in a large group with several parents and kids. I can understand that scenario a little more. So I'll back of my comments a little. 

I still think this is mostly on the parent but if the above is true less so.",news
iamaquantumcomputer,2016-05-29 22:30:57,"> you prepare for what you think can happen, but you won't prepare for what you think won't happen or don't know.

Exactly. And the reason I think the zoo is at fault, is because a toddler climbing through is something they should have thought can happen, but didn't. Toddlers are small and naturally explore or can get pushed around by the crowd. A toddler falling in is something that should have been anticipated.

We see more secure fences everyday protecting less dangerous things. You know how some buildings have floors that drop off to lower floors? When was the last time you saw a barrier on one of those upper floors that a toddler can climb through? Or when was the last time you saw the fence to a closed park be wide enough or high enough that a toddler can climb through? I bet probably never. Because the people who created those fences anticipated this. So why is it this was not anticipated when you have 400 lb endangered gorillas on the other side?

>Let's say a 3 yr old was kidnapped by a molester; are we going to blame the zoo or are we going to question the parent's judgment by not watching their kid?

I'm glad you bring this up because I think it's a great analogy to how I see the distribution of blame. First, to answer your question, in this scenario, no I do not believe the zoo would be at fault any yes, I do believe the parents would at fault for not keeping an eye on their kids. But primarily, the blame would be on the molester! When a kid gets kidnapped and molested, > 90% of the blame goes to the molester.

Similarly, when a kid can climb through the barrier and fall into a dangerous ape exhibit, yes, the parents have some blame for not keeping an eye on their kids, but the majority of the blame is on the zoo for making it possible for a toddler to easily get in in the first place.

The analogy continues that if you hear about a kidnapping, you can't really know how much blame to assign the parents until you hear the circumstances of the kidnapping. Was the kid walking around the neighborhood alone at night unsupervised? Or did the kidnapper gradually fool the mom that he can be trusted and then run off with the kid? Both of those scenarios are very different in how much fault the parents take, and when you hear of a kidnapping, you can't really judge until you find out these details. In this way, we don't know the specific circumstances of how the kid fell in. We don't know if the kid was being unruly and climbed through because his parents weren't controlling him, or he tripped through, or whether he wa pushed through by the crowd. And we can't really blame the parents until we know the specifics.

>Watching a kid isn't that damn hard. If you bring your kid into a place like a zoo, be prepared to mind them at all times or don't bring them.

Yes, I agree with that. On an individual scale, you can prevent your kid from falling in. But on a macro scale, if there's a small chance of an accident happening, with thousands of toddlers visiting the exhibit each year, it's only a matter of time before an accident happens. So while for each parent, the chances of the kid falling into the exhibit are astronomically small, if you were to think about the chances of it happening to someone over the course of decades of the zoos operation, you would find that the chances of it happening to *someone* are actually pretty high. Thus, the zoo should take preventative action",news

I did not realize you were an expert on Gorilla behavior? Please, tell me what zoo you work at so I can send a full throated apology. 

And you were anthropomorphizing. By asserting that the gorilla was protecting the boy, and being caring/gentle, you were placing human emotions of empathy and compassion on an animal that may have not been feeling those emotions in any way. You have no direct experience with this animal, and I assume are not one of his keepers that knows his behavior well enough to make a judgment call on the likely outcome of this event. 


And you're right, cases are rare. Cases are so rare, that it would be illogical to make an assumption that the outcome would have been similar to the ones you linked. Every gorilla is different, and every situation is different. You've given examples where the zoo's felt an alternative route was viable, and here's an example where a zoo felt the alternative was not viable. And I'll point out that the first video isn't a very good comparison. The gorilla never grabbed the little boy, and they eventually left him alone in a space where he could be grabbed. Description of that behavior as protective, could just as easily be written off as curious turned bored.
Regarding the Cincinnati issue: ""Fire officials witnessed the gorilla “violently dragging and throwing the child,” the station reported.""

Also, I'll just point out that I had no condescension in my prior comment. I'm being condescending now because you were rude, but I genuinely meant in my previous comment that I recognize it is difficult to not give an animal human emotions, and that the keepers should be trusted to know what is best with years of training.

Zoo ruminants are actually known to be rather susceptible to gut diseases/ disorders and malnutrition due to lack of roughage in zoo diets. Their rumen is not as full of pappiliae as their wild cousins because we often feed grain as a major part of their diet. Their guts are not as 'challenged' in their daily diet (grain is easy to digest) so when something foreign is ingested their gut can't handle it. 

Edit: that giraffe I mentioned above that ate windshield wipers and various other weird things: when she died of old age we did her necropsy and her rumen was beautifully full of pappiliae, much like a wild giraffe would be. Another of her herd who never ate weird things and loved grain was also necropsied and her rumen was smooth. These animals had the same diet, including lots of leaves and fiber. One ate weird stuff, the other didn't and it had a direct effect on their internal physiology.

I would probably pick up a 3 year old kid if it randomly ran into my house. I don't think I deserve to get shot for it. 

It seems like in this scenario there were two options:

(a) take no action and the kid might get hurt or not and the gorilla lives.

(b) take action to make sure that the kid doesn't get hurt and murder the gorilla.

In this case the kid is the person on the runaway trolley and the gorilla is the large man who you can push in front of the trolley to stop it. Except that in this case it wasn't the guaranteed death of 5 trolley passengers vs the guaranteed death of the large man.

I haven't seen a picture of the gorilla display or of the security measures surrounding it, but I will assume it was made (or still is) with the safety of visitors in mind. Gorillas are extraordinarily powerful animals that can tear a man in half, so keeping the two parties separate is probably something a zoo would want to do. And, realistically, people are stupid: I can imagine drunk college kids wanting to jump in with the gorillas or other animals. 

> I'm glad you bring this up because I think it's a great analogy to how I see the distribution of blame. First, to answer your question, in this scenario, no I do not believe the zoo would be at fault any yes, I do believe the parents would at fault for not keeping an eye on their kids. But primarily, the blame would be on the molester! When a kid gets kidnapped and molested, > 90% of the blame goes to the molester.

We do blame the perpetrator; however, in our society, we also look for a scapegoat for either the perpetrator or the parents, in this particular scenario. It's sad and pathetic, but it's the world we live in.

> But on a macro scale, if there's a small chance of an accident happening, with thousands of toddlers visiting the exhibit each year, it's only a matter of time before an accident happens.

This means most, if not all, incidents are preventable. The chance of an accident occurring are minuscule (statistical outliers), but, as you've stated do occur. The best prevention in scenarios like this are proper minding of children by parents. If you hold parents accountable for the actions of their children, while it may drive some people away, it will also foster greater coordination and cooperation between the zoo and parents to deter preventable accidents.

iameveryoneelse,2016-05-30 03:40:59,"I'm guessing you're somewhere south of about 21 years old...you don't realize it yet but there's a huge difference in looking after a sibling and trying to take care of multiple children while at a public zoo. Furthermore, I guarantee that your siblings were ""stupid enough"" to do something like this. At that age, kids are just starting to learn how to explore the world on their own, but the full understanding of cause and effect hasn't taken hold yet. 

I'm not completely absolving the parent of responsibility...my children would probably not ever have been in that situation (though I guarantee my youngest might have tried...she's the adventurous one of the two), but my point is that it should be reasonable for the zoo to expect young children to be running around. It should also be reasonable to assume that some subset of young children might try to get a closer view.  Because of that, if a child is able to get through the barriers, security just wasn't adequate.  It doesn't matter how long they've gone without an accident...that doesn't prove its safe or that the parent was irresponsible (do you really think there has never been a bad parent at that zoo in 36 years?)...all it proves is that it hadn't happened before. 

The fact is, it doesn't matter how good or bad a parent is...even the best parents have momentary lapses in judgement, or let their kid get a little too far out of reach, or get distracted.  Even the best four year olds get curious and four year olds rarely consider consequences...their brains just haven't developed to that point yet. The reason the zoo is at fault is because things DO happen, and parents should be able to expect reasonable security measures at an exhibit that primarily caters to children. 

Pretend you went to Disneyland with one of those siblings of yours and you both got on a children's ride.  Your sibling's restraint wasn't tight enough and he/she flew off the ride and got hurt. Was that your fault for not holding your sibling throughout the ride, or was it Disney's fault for not having harnesses that fit the target demographic of the ride?

Again, maybe this parent was in fact a horrible parent (though according to witnesses, it sounds like the child was being monitored but was able to slip away in just a second)...that still doesn't mean it was the parent's fault.  It's the zoo's job to ensure the safety of their customers, and in this case it clearly did not do so. ",news

 We only have those aspects.. civilization, art, science, etc... because we're so good at surviving we have energy left over.

hell___toupee,2016-05-29 09:21:51,"The full quote that you cited is:

>**[Zoo director] Maynard said the boy was never at risk**, though fire officials witnessed the gorilla “violently dragging and throwing the child,” the station reported.

Seems like what 'the station reported' was based on hearsay that was not an accurate portrayal of what actually happened.  I'll take the zoo director at his word when he says both that the boy was never at risk and that the boy was never attacked.

>By asserting that the gorilla was protecting the boy, and being caring/gentle, you were placing human emotions of empathy and compassion on an animal that may have not been feeling those emotions in any way

I didn't assert that, I asserted that was what witnesses thought it seemed like the gorilla was doing.  Further, gorillas are well known to be very gentle animals.  Still further, as great apes, we are extremely closely genetically related to gorillas so if there were any species of animal whose behavior humans would be able to interpret as being analogous to our own, it would be any other species of great ape.

You seem to be unable to admit that you were mistaken in wrongly asserting that the gorilla was harming the child.  Whether or not the decision that was made was the right one is certainly debatable and open to interpretation, but your claims about what was actually occurring were demonstrably false.",news

x2501x,2016-05-29 15:47:00,"If there are less than 4,000 members of a species left in the whole world, yes one member could potentially be very important. As I said, perhaps the zoo knew that this particularly gorilla was part of a genetic group who were well represented by other individuals and thus would not be a big loss, but there certainly could be cases where one out of 4,000 might represent the last or one of the last from a group which have very different traits from other members of the same species. If you have too much interbreeding between descendants of the same ancestors, that leads to weakness and genetic diseases (see: European royalty). Zoos that conduct breeding programs make a big effort to breed between individuals who come from different ancestral stock in order to maintain vitality in the entire species. This individual was 17 which means he had only just reached breeding age in the past couple years, and he might have lived another 20-25 years and been able to produce many offspring.

You are wrong to frame this as, ""If I had to choose between a gorilla and a human,"" because that isn't the point. You literally could have one individual from a species who is the key to the long-term future survival of that species, or in a case like this, you might have a few individuals who are important and by removing one, you're increasing the overall risk because you're removing redundancy which leaves more vulnerability if, say, the others get sick. The judgement here is, ""one person's life versus the loss in value to all future humans,"" not a human's life versus a gorilla's. 

You're right, though, that the zoo decided the child's life was more important, and they know more about the situation that either of us do. That doesn't mean that would always be true.

I edited my comment after talking to multiple people with kids who said how did the parents let that happen when they were told the story. If you can't even keep your kid in your sight you're a fucking imbecile and probably shouldn't have kids. The fact that you are defending kids who disobey their parents and get into trouble says a lot about you. Kids are kids. Kids will be kids. That's why there is such thing as parents to look after them. Don't be an ignoramus man. When you have a dog and its misbehaving you don't blame the dog.

iamaquantumcomputer,2016-05-29 11:36:20,"I'm not saying you're not responsible for your kids.

But if the zoo has the capacity to prevent **inevitable** deaths from its animals, it has an obligation to do so.

You keep saying that the parents are responsible for their child. Yes, I agree with that completely. That doesn't change the fact that when a zoo has dangerous animals, it has an obligation to make sure the exhibit is as safe as possible, in addition to people not doing anything stupid. The fact that toddlers are small, and can fit through barriers that can keep adults away, and that toddlers  can get pushed through by the crowd is something those that designed the barricade should have thought of. The fact that they did not is poor thinking on their part.

The purpose of a barricade is to prevent accidents. What I meant when I talked about negligence is that while I can understand the barrier failing to keep people out in situations that are not normal or not reasonable to anticipate, they should prevent deaths from common accidents that occur frequently and can be predicted. For example, if a person trips near the edge of the exhibit, it's supposed to prevent them from falling into the exhibit. Yes, it's the person's responsibility to try to not trip if possible and to watch where they're going, but the zoo puts up the barriers to prevent the person from falling in if and when it happens.

Similarly, yes a parent should keep an eye on their toddler. But if you're making an exhibit, and you know that there will be a lot of toddlers around, you should make your barriers be able to prevent them from going through as well. If you don't, then it's on you when they behave completely the way you'd expect toddlers to.

It's really not difficult or expensive to create a barrier that a toddler couldn't have climbed through. You see regular fences all the time that toddlers can't climb through. On the second floor of any building, if there's a drop to the floor below, there's always a barrier at least waist high that a kid can't fall through. We see more secure barriers blocking access to less dangerous places all the time in everyday life. You would think if the other side of the barrier had something that can threaten your life, it would be above average in security compared to the ones we see all the time, not less",news

The fact that you're comparing watching younger siblings to managing multiple children speaks to your inexperience in the issue.  Regardless, I digress.  I'm not really invested enough to try to convince random internet person to widen their perspective a bit.  

Regarding my example, the analogy is accurate.  The barrier is designed to keep someone in place, just as the harness is.  Maybe the harness has worked for 36 years because only specific conditions would cause it to fail.  While the child met the height requirements, the park didn't consider an exceptionally skinny child, for instance.

Again, the zoo not having had an accident in 36 years doesn't mean appropriate measures were taken, only that they hadn't been tested.  The fact that they failed is evidence that they were not, in fact, adequate. 

Everything else aside, the fact of the matter is that neither of us can really comment on whose fault it was because you don't have any more information than I do, and there is certainly not enough information to judge whether or not the parent was being attentive.  All we know is that the child was able to get away and that whatever measures the zoo had in place were not enough to prevent the child from falling in this scenario.  My only real point is that it's ridiculous to be so quick to blame the parents.  If the parent was some idiot holding their kid over the edge of the enclosure I'd be the first to agree with you, but I hesitate to blame a parent for a four year old getting away from his parents for a just a couple of seconds (which is how long witnesses said it took for the kid to get through the barriers).

What are the facts known at this time? Kid fell 12 feet into a gorilla enclosure. The zoo killed the male silverback gorilla. That's it. Zero facts, much less the inconvenient thing of letting a jury determine if the evidence works out in party's favor or not has yet to happen.

Yes that is what I'm comparing it to, because that's what we've got, a dead gorilla and a safe child.

>Why would you have any sympathy for the safe child

That is my point, I don't, because he's a safe child in this news piece. But the gorilla being a victim of circumstance gives me reason to feel sympathy, despite the action of killing him is still justified. I'm no expert so I'm more than happy to assume the action take was the correct one. That doesn't mean I don't feel sympathetic for the gorilla.

I actually just looked up the definition of sympathy because for a second I began to think I somehow had misunderstood it up to this point, but surely enough the definition says: ""feelings of pity and sorrow for someone else's misfortune."" I feel sad for the gorilla because of his misfortune, so the dictionary is telling me I am sympathetic towards the gorilla. The safe child is safe, that's great news, so I do not feel sympathy for him.

>The point isn't about the current event, it's the potential and hypothetical sympathy should the child have died.

Actually my point was about the current event. That's why its in the comments section of a link with the current event. You brought up the dead child, that wasn't a previous part of that discussion from the parent comments up to that point. I think there's a misunderstanding somewhere here.

A hypothetical situation that could (or should to some others) have happened, thus it makes sense all following sympathy for the child would be directed to the sacrificed child (unless specifically stated otherwise.)

If you're suggesting there are people who don't understand other people's emotional responses, whether or not they personally agree with them, then yes. Psycopaths are scary.


But it is absolutely possible to believe our human lives are no more inherently valuable than any other, and as I stated before, the only reason not to share this opinion (besides some sort of religious delusion of us ""having souls"" or being in some way divine or 'above' all other animals) is an instinctual one-- the instinct to protect our own offspring. I can understand that, because I have sympathy and empathy.


But we don't *all* have offspring, and not *all* offspring belong to us individually, so unless you're talking about your own kid being in danger, there's no reason to think that child's life has any greater intrinsic value than any other life.


What I'm saying is this: I can understand why the parents might want the keepers to shoot the gorilla to save their kid. But I don't agree that was the fairest decision from an objective viewpoint.

deleted,2016-05-29 19:04:50,I believe the zoo has barriers to keep the animals contained as well as to keep humans out. That's why one side usually has instructions written to humans that say keep off fence or not to lean over the wall (and why they even have a wall to begin with). It's obvious that it serves both functions. But feel free to ignore that aspect.,news

Within moments the kid had made it through the bushes and through the wall. Why is this so hard for you to grasp? Why would we not implement a wall where a fucking 3 year old can't make it through?

You asked why this hasn't happened? Who knows. Maybe the kid is autistic or disabled and couldn't tell the difference. Dad sets him down and talks to mom and your kid is gone.

Still gonna be the zoo's fault? I suppose you'll suggest they should have a full on cage around it. Then some kid gets through that and they kill another gorilla. Still the zoo's fault because, fuck it, why not? So then they make the cage smaller and put in a moat around the enclosure and then 70ft of barbed wire in between that and the outter fence(also covered in 4.5ft of barbed wire).
